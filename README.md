## Project 1 explanation
Code bithumb_BTC_assign.py generates bitcoin orderbook data CSV file with data from bithumb exchange. Output file name is "book-year-month-day-bithumb.csv". It builds orderbook of level 5, timestamp = 5 seconds.
Code bithumb_ETH_assign.py generates etherium orderbook data. Output file name is "book-year-month-day-bithumb-eth.csv". Other details are same with bitcoin file.
Note that bitcoin output file name is just "book-year-month-day-bithumb.csv", not "book-year-month-day-bithumb-btc.csv". Maybe "book-year-month-day-bithumb-btc.csv" would be a better name to distinguish bitcoin and etherium orderbook, but we've already got our orderbook files with name "book-year-month-day-bithumb.csv" and changing the code and modify .csv file names to fit into changed code would be some kind of cheat. Sorry for the inconvience if you confused from file names.
